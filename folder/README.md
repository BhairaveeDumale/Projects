Student Score Dashboard

A beginner-friendly Python project that simulates a basic student performance dashboard. It uses core Python concepts like lists, dictionaries, functions, loops, and conditionals — along with libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for data analysis and visualization.


Features:

1.Store student data (name & score)

2.Calculate average score

3.Identify top scorer

4.Determine pass/fail status

5.Visualize data with:

-Bar charts (student scores)

-Pie charts (pass vs fail ratio)

6.DataFrame creation and filtering using pandas
